Idea gathering and organizing task management system

Purpose
+++++++
Speedily Gather and Organize ideas so ideas don't get lost and so projects you are thinking about or working on are well documented and can be picked up or paused but not lost, forgotten, or abandoned.

Objectives
++++++++++
 *   Fast input of ideas;
 *   Flexible organization scheme;
 *   Easy to use;
 *   Beautiful;

Features
++++++++
 *   Everything is a project
 *   A project is made up of 
    1. sub projects/tasks, 
    2. research and 
    3. backburner items 
	(items that may be out of scope but may be good ideas for the future)


Philosophies

"When people are organized, they get more finised"
--------------------------------------------------
The idea here is that progress can't be made if ideas stay in peoples' heads as ideas. They need to be thrown around with others and executed. If ideas are collected, organized, and executed, everyone benifits from the possibility of more good ideas.

"But not all ideas are good!"
I understand that, but that is outside the scope of this project. This is only interested in the collection and organization of information and ideas so more ideas get executed. Filtering out bad ideas only happens in a public space with good feedback. But that's for another project; that's not what this project is about.


"Everything is a Project"
-------------------------
Every task is really a project with smaller subtasks, which in turn could have subtasks/projects of its own.

Many tasks can be broken up into groups of even smaller, easier tasks, some of which could be broken down into even smaller tasks.
